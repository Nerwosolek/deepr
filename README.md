<!-- TODO: abstract -->

For many students around the world, educational resources are hardly
affordable. Therefore, I have decided that this book should remain
an independent, non-profit, open-access project.
Whilst, for some people, the presence of a "designer tag" from a
major publisher might still be a proxy for quality, it is my hope
that this publication will prove useful to those who seek knowledge for
knowledge's sake.

You can read it at:

* <https://deepr.gagolewski.com/deepr.pdf> (PDF)

**Please spread the news about this project.**

## About the Author

[Marek Gagolewski][1]
is currently a Senior Lecturer in Applied AI at Deakin University in Melbourne,
Australia and an Associate Professor in Data Science (on leave) at the Faculty
of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.

His research interests are related to data science, in particular: modelling
complex phenomena, developing usable, general purpose algorithms, studying
their analytical properties, and finding out how people use, misuse,
understand, and misunderstand methods of data analysis in research, commercial,
and decision making settings.

He's an author of 90+ publications, including journal papers
in outlets such as *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*,
*Information Fusion*, *International Journal of Forecasting*,
*Statistical Modelling*, *Journal of Statistical Software*,
*Information Sciences*, *Knowledge-Based Systems*,
*IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems*, and *Journal of Informetrics*.

In his "spare" time, he writes books for his students
(check out his [*Minimalist Data Wrangling with Python*](https://datawranglingpy.gagolewski.com/))
and develops open-source
(libre) data analysis software, such as
[`stringi`](https://stringi.gagolewski.com) –
one of the most often downloaded R packages,
[`genieclust`](https://genieclust.gagolewski.com) – a fast and robust
hierarchical clustering algorithm in both Python and R,
and many [others](https://github.com/gagolews).
