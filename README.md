# [Deep R Programming](https://deepr.gagolewski.com/)

<a href="https://deepr.gagolewski.com/"><img src="docs/_static/img/cover.png" align="right" height="225" /></a>

*Deep R Programming* is a comprehensive and in-depth introductory course on one of the most popular languages for data science. It equips ambitious students, professionals, and researchers with the knowledge and skills to become independent users of this potent environment so that they can tackle any problem related to data wrangling and analytics, numerical computing, statistics, and machine learning.

For many students around the world, educational resources are hardly
affordable. Therefore, I have has decided that this book should remain
an independent, non-profit, open-access project. You can read it at:

* <https://deepr.gagolewski.com/> (a browser-friendly version)
* <https://deepr.gagolewski.com/deepr.pdf> (PDF)

You can also order a
[paper copy](https://deepr.gagolewski.com/order-paper-copy.html).

Whilst, for some people, the presence of a "designer tag" from a
major publisher might still be a proxy for quality, it is my hope
that this publication will prove useful to those who seek knowledge for
knowledge's sake.

**Please spread the news about this project.**

## About the Author

Dr habil. [Marek Gagolewski][1]
is currently a Senior Lecturer in Data Science/Applied AI
at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia.

His research interests are related to data science, in particular: modelling
complex phenomena, developing usable, general-purpose algorithms, studying
their analytical properties, and finding out how people use, misuse,
understand, and misunderstand methods of data analysis in research, commercial,
and decision-making settings.

He's an author of 90+ publications, including journal papers
in outlets such as *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*,
*Journal of Statistical Software*, *The R Journal*, *Information Fusion*,
*International Journal of Forecasting*, *Statistical Modelling*,
*Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications*,
*Information Sciences*, *Knowledge-Based Systems*,
*IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems*, and *Journal of Informetrics*.

In his "spare" time, he writes books for his students
(check out his [*Minimalist Data Wrangling with Python*](https://datawranglingpy.gagolewski.com/))
and develops open-source data analysis software, such as
[`stringi`](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/) (one of the most often downloaded
R packages),
[`genieclust`](https://genieclust.gagolewski.com/) (a fast and robust
hierarchical clustering algorithm in both Python and R),
and many [others](https://github.com/gagolews).
